abstract: Micro-expression recognition (MER) is highly challenging due to the subtle
  and rapid facial muscle movements and the scarcity of annotated data. Existing methods
  typically rely on pixel-level motion descriptors such as optical flow and frame
  difference, which tend to be sensitive to identity and lack generalization. In this
  work, we propose D-FACE, a Discrete Facial ACtion Encoding framework that leverages
  large-scale facial video data to pretrain an identity- and domain-invariant facial
  action tokenizer, for MER. For the first time, MER is shifted from relying on pixel-level
  motion descriptors to leveraging semantic-level facial action tokens, providing
  compact and generalizable representations of facial dynamics. Empirical analyses
  reveal that these tokens exhibit position-dependent semantics, motivating sequential
  modeling. Building on this insight, we employ a Transformer with sparse attention
  pooling to selectively capture discriminative action cues. Furthermore, to explicitly
  bridge action tokens with human-understandable emotions, we introduce an emotion-description-guided
  CLIP (EDCLIP) alignment. EDCLIP leverages textual prompts as semantic anchors for
  representation learning, while enforcing that the others category, which lacks corresponding
  prompts due to its ambiguity, remains distant from all anchor prompts. Extensive
  experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our method achieves not only state-of-the-art
  recognition accuracy but also high-quality cross-identity and even cross-domain
  micro-expression generation, suggesting a paradigm shift from pixel-level to generalizable
  semantic-level facial motion analysis.
