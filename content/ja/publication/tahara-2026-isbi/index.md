abstract: High annotation costs are a significant barrier in time-lapse cell imaging,
  as cell density increases over time, leading to numerous adjoining and difficult-to-distinguish
  boundaries. Our work is based on the observation that sparse images, which are less
  costly to annotate, still contain local regions with cell densities comparable to
  those in dense data. We aim to generate dense data from these sparse images for
  data augmentation. While attempting to bridge the significant dis- tribution gap
  between the training (sparse) and target (dense) data in a single large step is
  a viable approach, it can lead to instabilities in the generation process, resulting
  in unrealistic images. We find that generation is more stable when this gap is bridged
  incrementally. Therefore, we propose stepwise generation, a diffusion model based
  method that incremen- tally bridges this distribution gap. This approach successfully
  generates realistic images usable for augmentation. Fur- thermore, a cell detector
  trained with data augmented by the generated images achieved high detection accuracy
  (F1 score) on dense data, surpassing conventional methods. This code is available
  at https://github.com/Masashi-Tahara/Bridging-the- Density-Gap.
